                        On the launch of the Cru Central Coast App for the first time, you will be prompted to agree to our Terms of Service and to allow or deny access to push notifications and location services. The Terms of Service can be found below by following the Terms link at the bottom of the page. Cru Central Coast uses your location, if allowed, to make the RideSharing section of the App easy to use. Cru Central Coast uses push notifications to make users aware of changes to events or other information related only to the ministries the user is signed up for.

                    <p>
                        After agreeing to the Terms of Service and allowing or denying push notifications and location services, you will be prompted to select which campuses and ministries you want to be a part of. The focuses of Cru Central Coast’s ministries are different and are outlined below. Each ministry is open to any and all students and faculty to attend. You may sign up for more than one ministry, but must sign up for one in order to continue in the App.

                        This tab is divided into two pieces, the section on Community Groups and that of Ministry Teams. Community Groups are groups of students and faculty getting together to get to know one another more deeply and talk about spiritual topics. Ministry Teams offer ways to help out with events and become active in helping Cru Central Coast move forward.

                    Drivers who are not leaders are required to sign-up in person with a Cru Central Coast staff member, student leader, or faculty leader. This is to prevent drivers unassociated with Cru Central Coast from picking up students and faculty. Please see one of the people in those roles to sign-up to be a driver. Once you have gone through this process once, you don’t have to do it again.
